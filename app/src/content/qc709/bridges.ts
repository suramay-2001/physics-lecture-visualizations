/**
 * Physics 709's bridges into Spin Lab (W-709-platform §C): id → the 448 unit (or 709 Foundations chapter) that
 * teaches what a 709 chapter assumes. Prose links one with `<<id|shown text>>`; a gloss entry offers one with
 * `bridge: id`. Ids start `qc-` (content/courses.test.ts). content/qc709/bridges.test.ts checks that every id a chapter
 * or gloss uses is here, that every target resolves in its course (lecture, unit, beat), and that no entry is unused.
 *
 * Empty until the first chapters land (F1, Q1 are being planned); the DEV demo chapter Q0 carries its own table
 * (`DEMO_BRIDGES`), which never ships. Part of the lazy course pack (pack.ts), never the main chunk.
